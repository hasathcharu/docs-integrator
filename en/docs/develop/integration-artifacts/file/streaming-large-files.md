# Streaming Large Files

By default, a file handler loads the whole file into memory before it runs. For files in the hundreds of megabytes or larger, that can exhaust the integration's memory budget. Turning on **Stream (Large Files)** when you add a handler changes this: the runtime delivers the content to the handler a row (CSV) or chunk (RAW) at a time, so memory use stays flat no matter how big the file is.

## When to stream

| Scenario | What to pick |
|---|---|
| Files smaller than ~50 MB | Leave **Stream** off. Simpler handler code, and you get the whole file at once. |
| CSV files larger than ~50 MB | Tick **Stream**. Define a row schema so each row arrives as a typed record. |
| Binary files larger than ~50 MB | Pick **RAW** as the File Format and tick **Stream**. Chunks arrive as `byte[]`. |

Streaming is supported on **CSV** and **RAW** handlers only. **JSON** and **XML** are always parsed as a single document — tick **Stream** on those formats and the form ignores it.

## Enabling streaming

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ui" label="Visual Designer" default>

On the Add File Handler form:

1. Pick **onCreate** as the handler variant and the appropriate **File Format** — **CSV** or **RAW**.
2. (CSV only) Click **+ Define Row Schema** and describe each column as a field on a Ballerina record — for example, a row with `orderId` / `quantity` / `unitPrice`. This lets each row arrive as a typed record instead of a raw `string[]`.
3. Tick **Stream (Large Files)**.
4. Fill in **After File Processing** and the rest of the form as usual, then click **Save**.

The handler is saved with its `content` parameter wrapped in a stream — `stream<Order, error?>` for a typed CSV, `stream<string[], error?>` if you skipped the row schema, or `stream<byte[], error?>` for RAW.

**Streaming CSV into typed records:**

```ballerina
type Order record {|
    string orderId;
    string customerId;
    string product;
    int quantity;
    decimal unitPrice;
|};

service on ftpListener {

    @ftp:FunctionConfig {
        afterProcess: {moveTo: string `/processed`},
        afterError: {moveTo: string `/errors`}
    }
    remote function onFileCsv(stream<Order, error?> content,
                              ftp:FileInfo fileInfo) returns error? {
        check content.forEach(function(Order 'order) {
            log:printInfo(string `Order: ${'order.orderId}, Qty: ${'order.quantity}`);
        });
    }
}
```

**Streaming raw CSV rows** (skip the row schema — each row is a `string[]`):

```ballerina
remote function onFileCsv(stream<string[], error?> content,
                          ftp:FileInfo fileInfo) returns error? {
    check content.forEach(function(string[] row) {
        // row[0], row[1], … — positional column access
    });
}
```

**Streaming binary chunks:**

```ballerina
remote function onFile(stream<byte[], error?> content,
                       ftp:FileInfo fileInfo) returns error? {
    check content.forEach(function(byte[] chunk) {
        // write each chunk to a local file, an outbound HTTP body, etc.
    });
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## When a row fails to parse

By default, if a row can't be parsed (wrong type for a typed schema, malformed CSV), the stream terminates at that row. The handler's `on fail` branch catches the error and the file moves to the **After Error** destination as usual.

The important detail for streaming: **every row delivered before the failing row has already been processed by your handler.** If your handler has side effects — database writes, API calls, message publishes — those are committed for the rows that arrived before the failure. Rows at or after the failure are never delivered.

Retrying a streamed file (a manual re-upload of a corrected file, or rerunning against the original) replays side effects for the already-processed rows. So, handlers that write to downstream state should either:

- **Be idempotent** - Check-then-write patterns so a replayed row doesn't create a duplicate.
- **Track per-file progress externally** - Store a last-processed offset keyed by filename; on retry, skip rows already recorded.

If you'd rather skip malformed rows and keep the stream going, enable [CSV fault tolerance](csv-fault-tolerance.md) on the listener. This ensures that bad rows are logged and dropped, while valid rows continue to flow through the handler.
